# [FdelMazo.github.io](https://fdelmazo.github.io/)
Personal portfolio website, with projects, collaborations, and stuff

This site uses:

* [Freelancer-theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme): The original Jekyll theme, used as a template and then heavily modified
* [githubchart-api](https://github.com/2016rshah/githubchart-api): A Github API to display the commit contribution calendar, used as the background for the website title
* [github-cards](https://github.com/lepture/github-cards): A little widget to display the Github profile on a website, modified to suit my style (image on top as cover, everything left aligned, etc)
* [Github-Repo-Widget](https://github.com/hustcc/GitHub-Repo-Widget.js): A widget to display the Github repository of a project, modified so that I can place an image between the header and footer, and with a star counter
