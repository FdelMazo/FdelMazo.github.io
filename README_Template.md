# Video Manager
Personal movie manager and downloader, in Python 3.

### Quick usage:
- Throw manager.py and rarbgapi.py to the working folder and just write **python manager.py**
	- Cleans of files that are not movies or subtitles
	- Renames the subtitle found to match the videofile
	- If no subtitle found it downloads it
	- Renames the folder to "Movie (year) [quality]"
	- If the folder wasn't automatically renamed, rerun with -k and manually input it
	
	- The **--print-only flag** (as in "python manager.py --print-only")  serves as to not modify a thing but only show (good for first time uses)

	
	
### Advanced usage:
- python manager.py fetch
	- Searchs for movies in bad quality and puts them all in a txt file
	- Output txt file can be changed with --output

- python manager.py download
	- Receives the txt file generated by fetch and downloads every movie in good quality
	- Input txt file can be changed with --input
	
- python manager.py check
	- Shows a list of every directory with more than 2 files
	- The quantity to be checked can be changed with --check
	
- python manager.py subtitles
	- Just takes care of the subtitles, without renaming or touching any video file or directory
